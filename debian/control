Description: debhelper buildsystem for Rust crates using Cargo
 dh-cargo provides a debhelper buildsystem to build Rust crates using Cargo.
 .
 This builds Debian rust crates to be installed into a system-level crate
 registry in /usr/share/cargo/registry containing crates that can be used and
 Build-Depended upon by other Debian packages.
 .
 Debian packages generated by debcargo use this buildsystem; packagers are not
 expected to use this directly. If you have a multi-language program such as
 firefox or librsvg that includes private Rust crates not exposed to others,
 you should instead use our cargo wrapper /usr/share/cargo/bin/cargo in the
 cargo package, and Build-Depends on that instead of this package.
